## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Ship OMO defaults in omo.jsonc format
AI-EngKit SHALL ship its OMO agent defaults as an omo.jsonc-format template (`.opencode/omo.jsonc.default`), baked into the image at `/etc/opencode/omo.jsonc.default`. The template SHALL contain the supported agent presets and SHALL conform to the schema of the pinned OMO release. Agent entries SHALL NOT contain a `permission` key; required per-tool restrictions SHALL use schema-valid `tools` booleans. Primary model overrides SHALL use top-level `agents.<name>.model`, and the template SHALL NOT contain model entries under `[opencode].agents`.

#### Scenario: Image contains omo.jsonc default
- **WHEN** the Docker image is built
- **THEN** `/etc/opencode/omo.jsonc.default` parses as valid JSONC, contains no agent `permission` key or `[opencode].agents` model layer, and passes the pinned OMO config migration dry run without validation errors

#### Scenario: Legacy template no longer installed to runtime config
- **WHEN** a container starts from the image
- **THEN** the entrypoint does not create or update `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-openagent.json`

#### Scenario: Read-only restrictions use tools
- **WHEN** a shipped agent preset restricts shell or write tools
- **THEN** those restrictions are represented under `agents.<name>.tools` with boolean values

### Requirement: Runtime omo.jsonc generation and merge
The entrypoint SHALL ensure `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` exists and SHALL idempotently normalize known incompatible settings before OMO starts. It SHALL remove stale `[opencode].agents` model entries, convert known per-tool `permission` allow/deny entries to equivalent `tools` booleans, remove redundant allow-all permission entries, and preserve top-level `agents.<name>.model` plus unrelated user settings. If an unsupported permission shape cannot be converted without changing meaning, startup SHALL preserve the original value and report an actionable validation error rather than silently deleting it.

#### Scenario: First start creates omo.jsonc from default
- **WHEN** a container starts with an empty `~/.omo/`
- **THEN** `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` is created from the shipped defaults without unsupported permission or stale migration model entries

#### Scenario: Known stale settings are normalized
- **WHEN** an existing file contains `[opencode].agents.librarian.model` and known agent `permission` entries alongside `agents.librarian.model`
- **THEN** the stale migration agent layer is removed, known tool restrictions are represented under `tools`, and the top-level librarian model is preserved

#### Scenario: Unrelated customization is preserved
- **WHEN** normalization processes an existing user configuration
- **THEN** unrelated top-level keys, unrelated agent settings, and the `$schema` value remain unchanged

#### Scenario: User customizations preserved across restarts
- **WHEN** a normalized user configuration contains supported custom agent models, tools, or unrelated settings and the container restarts
- **THEN** those supported customizations remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Idempotent repeated starts
- **WHEN** the normalized container starts again without user edits
- **THEN** `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` is byte-identical after the second startup

#### Scenario: Unsupported permission shape is not silently weakened
- **WHEN** an existing permission value cannot be represented by the supported `tools` map
- **THEN** the entrypoint retains that value, reports the incompatible path, and does not claim normalization succeeded
